<p>This is a fullstack ecommerce website carefully curated using PHP Laravel</p>
<p>It's simple to use, after cloning it first run <b>cp.env.example.env</b> to get your enviornment variable</p>
<p>After run <i>composer install to get all the dependencies the <b>php artisan key:generate</i> to get the application key. Run your migration and build the application afterwards for production since the frontend assets</p>
<p>are served on a different port using vite, so during development you'll have 2 instances of the terminal running one for <b>php artisan serve</b> and the other for <b>npm run dev.</b></p>
